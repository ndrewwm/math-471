<!-- 1. The distribution of resistance for resistors having a nominal value of 10 ohms is under investigation. An electrical engineer randomly selects 73 resistors and measures their resistance. Based on these 73 values, she determines that the resistance of the resistors has the following behavior: approximately 70% of resistors have resistance within one standard deviation of 10 ohms, 95% are within two standard deviations, and none of the resistors have resistance greater than three standard deviations from 10 ohms. The distribution of resistance for resistors is __? -->

1. Normal <!-- good, empirical rule -->

<!-- 2. A computer chip is manufactured and then tested prior to delivery to the customer. The time to failure of the chip, X is to be modeled. The distribution of X is __. -->

2. Exponential

<!-- 3. In an epidemiological study of the incidence of skin cancer for those individuals who use artificial tanning procedures, a researcher decided to interview the customers of a nationally operating tanning facility. She continued calling customers until she found 100 who had contracted skin cancer. The number of N of people interviewed is recorded and used in the analysis. The distribution of N is __? -->

3. Negative Binomial <!-- good, https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/lesson/11/11.4 -->

<!-- 4. The number of customers demanding service during a one-hour period of time at Dutch Bros on Broadway Ave is modeled by a Poisson distribution. Let Y be the time needed for the next three customers to be served. The distribution of Y is __. -->

4. Gamma <!-- good, https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/lesson/15/15.4 -->

<!-- 5. An investigation is conducted to determine if the water discharged from a nuclear power plant is detrimental to the zoo-plankton in the discharge lake. A 1-liter sample of water is taken from the lake and the number, M, of zoo-plankton in the sample is recorded. The distribution of M is __? -->

5. Poisson <!-- good, https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/lesson/12/12.1 -->

<!-- 6. Let the time to failure of an electrical component be a random variable, T. The hazards rate of T is given by the function, $\lambda(t) = 3t^3$. The distribution of T is __. -->

6. Weibull <!-- good, hazard rate depends on *t* -->

<!-- 7. Demands for parts from an inventory occur in a random fashion, that is, the arrival of a request for parts in any 1-minute interval is independent of the requests in any other 1-minute interval. The average number of requests per 1-minute interval is a constant. Let X be the number of 1-minute intervals observed until the first request for a part occurs. The distribution of X is __? -->

7. Geometric <!-- good, https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/lesson/11/11.1 -->

<!-- 8. For each day during a six-month period in Boise, Idaho, the maximum daily ozone reading, M, was recorded. The distribution of M is __. -->

8. Weibull <!-- good, he mentioned this in class -->

<!-- 9. A manufacturer of piston rings measures the deviation of the true diameter from the nominal value. This measurements is known to have a standard normal distribution. A random sample of 8 rings yield deviations, $X_1, X_2, ..., X_8$. The random variable D, which is defined by $D = \frac{5\Sigma_{i = 1}^{3}X_i^2}{3\Sigma_{i = 4}^{8}X_i^2}$, is then computed. The distribution of D is __. -->

9. Fisher <!-- good, explanation in class discord -->

<!-- 10. Suppose that the arrivals of commercial aircrafts at Boise Air Terminal follows a Poisson distribution with rate 8 aircraft per hour. The length of the time, L, between arrivals of those commercial aircraft is recorded. The distribution of L is __. -->

10. Exponential <!-- good, classic use of Exp -->

<!-- 11. The average number of radioactive particles passing through a counter during 1-millisecond is a constant. Over the next 10 seconds, let W be the number of 1-millisecond periods in which 2 or more particles are counted. The distribution of W is __? -->

11. Binomial
