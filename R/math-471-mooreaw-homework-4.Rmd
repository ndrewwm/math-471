## MATH-471, Homework 4

The Poisson distribution is a potential candidate for the data that's been collected. We will maximize the likelihood function, which has one parameter of interest, $\lambda$.

$$
L(x; \lambda) = f(x; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!} \text{ for } x = 0, 1, 2, ... \text{ and } \lambda > 0.
$$
Taking the natural log of $L$, we have

$$
lnL(x; \lambda) = xln(\lambda) - \lambda - ln(x!).
$$

Differentiating $lnL$ results in 

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} \big[ lnL(x; \lambda) \big] = \frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\big[ xln(\lambda) - \lambda - ln(x!) \big] = \frac{x}{\lambda} - 1
\end{align*}

Setting the equation to 0, we have

\begin{align*}
0 &= \frac{x}{\lambda} - 1 \\
1 &= \frac{x}{\lambda} \\
\lambda &= x
\end{align*}

We can test whether this point is the global maximum by using the 2nd-derivative test. Taking the second derivative of $lnL$ we have

$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2\lambda} \big[ ln(L(x; \lambda)) \big] = \frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} \big[ \frac{x}{\lambda} - 1 \big] = \frac{-x}{\lambda^2}
$$

Substituting $\lambda$ in for $x$, we receive

$$
-\frac{\lambda}{\lambda^2} = -\frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

This value is negative, and will be negative for all $\lambda$ (because, by definition, $\lambda \geq 0$). This means that we have found the global maximum.
